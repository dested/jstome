The story unfolds against the backdrop of Utah in 1941, a time of social upheaval, war brewing overseas, and a city teeming with both humans and dinosaurs.\n\nThe show follows the lives of a diverse ensemble of characters, each with their own struggles, ambitions, and relationships with the dinosaur mailmen. At the center of the narrative is Detective Jack Malone, a gritty and determined cop who is tasked with unraveling a series of mysterious crimes that have been plaguing the city. His partner, Sarah Campbell, brings a fresh perspective and a strong intuition to the investigation.\n\nAs Jack and Sarah delve deeper into the seedy underbelly of Utah, they encounter a colorful cast of suspects, allies, and foes, including a rogue gang of velociraptors led by the cunning and charismatic Crimson Claw. The line between friend and foe blurs as alliances shift, secrets are revealed, and the true nature of the dinosaur mailmen is brought to light.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions escalate between the human population and the dinosaur community, leading to a power struggle that threatens to tear the city apart. Against this backdrop, Jack and Sarah must navigate treacherous alliances, outwit dangerous adversaries, and confront their own personal demons as they race against time to solve the case and restore order to Utah.\n\nThrough its thrilling blend of crime noir, alternative history, and prehistoric intrigue, \"Jurassic Deliveries\" weaves a complex and gripping narrative that challenges our assumptions about power, loyalty, and identity in a world where dinosaurs are not just relics of the past, but living, breathing members of society."
